# Token Viewer App

Just a simple token viewer app made in **NextJS** and **React**, search for common coins like ETH & USDT, view a simple description, and click on the link if want more info

Has a local database: ```database.ts```, which contains all the tokens and their basic info

I just made this as a pet project to get familiar with NextJS, React and Mantine, if anyone wants to contribute, they could add some Tokens in the database or add some more fields to the Token class, and update all the other tokens accordingly
